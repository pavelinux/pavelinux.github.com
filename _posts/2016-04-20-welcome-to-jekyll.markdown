We start this blog by defining our goals:

* In this blog we want to describe and explain the usage and configuration for
applications and programs such as: Netfilter/iptables, OpenSSH, 
netcat, nmap and many more.

* We want to talk about programming in Python, bash (and others) while enjoying a delicious
cup of coffee.

So, let's start...
