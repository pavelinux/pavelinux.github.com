[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html) is an *old-classical editor from the UNIX* world that has been ported to almost any
computer platform. The power comes to Emacs under your fingers when you discover some basic cappabilities.

Here we list just a few:

* The use of *buffers*.
* *Mouseless* interaction is better.
* Working through the text console and via ssh.
* Graphical customizable interface.

However the power behind Emacs is much greater. There are macros and third-party plugins that puts Emacs to a
higher level. For example:

* The [Melpa project](http://melpa.org/#/getting-started) contains more than three thousand packages which range from working with *regexp*
to play *spotify* or check friends timelines in twitter. Of course, the real value for a programmer is in all the available packages for every
programming language. Coming from control versions systems to syntax highlighting support, you can find in Emacs and its surrounding projects
a myriad of tools to speed up your dev-project.

* The default package repository [elpa](http://elpa.gnu.org/) which is available from 24.1 versions or higher and contains packages which are
managed by [GNU project](https://www.gnu.org/)

* Derivatives and forks of GNU Emacs project. For example in the [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/) distribution there is a samll text editor which resembles closely
to Emacs. On Mac you can install the 24.5-1 universal binary version from https://emacsformacosx.com/ or http://aquamacs.org/ which has a very good support for LaTeX

In conclussion, you can get the most and mastering Emacs using it and reading
the [official documentation](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/documentation.html)
