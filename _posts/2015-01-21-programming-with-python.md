##The goals

We start this serie of posts by defining our purposes:

* To develop small and simple models using programming elements and structures based on Numerical Methods notes to develop Python programs. 
* This programs should give an approximation to previously defined physical problems.
* These results may be improved by iteration or redefiniton of the models.
