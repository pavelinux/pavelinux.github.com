**A Cup of Python** is a personal blog about some Python projects and Sysadmin
duties in GNU/Linux and UNIX.

We start this serie of posts by defining some goals, topics and categories. In this blog we:

* Develop small and simple models using programming elements and structures
based on Numerical Methods.
* This programs should give an approximation to previously defined numerical or physical problems.
* These results may be improved by iteration or redefiniton of the models.
* Also we explain some sysadmin tasks (in Linux, mainly) which are solved
for not reinveinting the wheel

Here are some recent posts for start reading A Cup of Python!
